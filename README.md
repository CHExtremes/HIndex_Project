# HIndex_Project
This project is design to take the h-index princple used in acadamia in regards to published papers and apply that concept to weather 
analysis and forcasting. The format for the h-index is that there are h instances of h event. For example, if you have and h-index of 30
as a academic writer, you have 30 papers that have been cited at least 30 times. For temperature, and H-index looks at temperature in 
Farenheit. For example, and H-index of 87 would indicate that, for some location, 87 days in the year had temperatures of 87Â°F or greater.
